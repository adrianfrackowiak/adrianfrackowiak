          Frontend Developer, currently living in Poland near Pozna≈Ñ. I create
          websites and web apps using React, TypeScript, and a lot of popular
          frameworks and libraries. My passion for websites has started when I
          was 13 or 14 years old. I was so happy when I created my first website
          (probably the phpBB forum).

          When I am not working, I try myself in extreme sports like
          skateboarding and snowboarding. Popular "surf life" is my dream;
          freedom, nature, etc. I am also a big fan of Harry Potter and
          Wizarding World.
